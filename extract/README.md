Prioritizing to-fix data in key places

- just a random list of cities for now, might focus on certain factors later
- we can look at an economic GDP per city and use that as our list later


### Scripts
- `geocode.sh` - `sh geocode.sh "place"` - geocodes the place, saves the result
in `places/*.geojson`, meant to be a way to easily seed bboxes
- `manyGeocode.sh` - `sh manyGeocode.sh` - geocode a list of places with `geocode.sh` quickly
